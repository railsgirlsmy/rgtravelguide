  {name: "Kyoto, Japan", image: "kyoto-japan.jpg", title: "Top 10 Things To Do in Kyoto", post: "1) Visit Kinkaku-ji and marvel its reflections from the calm lake. Kinkakuji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion) is a Zen temple in northern Kyoto whose top two floors are completely covered in gold leaf. \r\n\r\n2) Visit Ryoan-ji. Ryoanji Temple (龍安寺, Ryōanji) is the site of Japan's most famous rock garden, which attracts hundreds of visitors every day. Originally an aristocrat's villa during the Heian Period, the site was converted into a Zen temple in 1450 and belongs to the Myoshinji school of the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism.\r\n\r\n3) Stalk a geisha at Gion. Gion (祇園) is Kyoto's most famous geisha district, located around Shijo Avenue between Yasaka Shrine in the east and the Kamo River in the west. It is filled with shops, restaurants and ochaya (teahouses), where geiko (Kyoto dialect for geisha) and maiko (geiko apprentices) entertain.\r\n\r\n4) Try Kyo-Roryi, or known as \"Kyoto Cuisine\". For a quintessential Kyo-ryori experience, head to Gion and the 100-year-old Minokou restaurant, where they do an 11-course Kyo-ryori dinner for ¥15,600, as well as lunchtime sampler sets presented in shiny lacquer ware bento boxes for ¥4,000. \r\n\r\n5) Experience a tea ceremony and making your own tea the Japanese way. The cleansing of the tea utensils, the gentle bow as you receive your cup, the three clockwise turns before you take a sip: it's not difficult to see how deeply rooted the slow and graceful movements of the tea ceremony are in Zen Buddhism.\r\n\r\n6) Visit the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine and run through its many torii (shrine gates). Fushimi Inari is the most important of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice. Foxes are thought to be Inari's messengers, resulting in many fox statues across the shrine grounds. \r\n\r\n7) Visit the Kiyomizu-dera temple. Kiyomizudera (清水寺, literally \"Pure Water Temple\") is one of the most celebrated temples of Japan. It was founded in 780 on the site of the Otowa Waterfall in the wooded hills east of Kyoto, and derives its name from the fall's pure waters.\r\n\r\n8) Stop by the Nishiki Market for fresh seafood! Nishiki Market (錦市場, Nishiki Ichiba), also known as \"Kyoto's Kitchen\" is a narrow, five block long shopping street lined by more than one hundred shops and restaurants. \r\n\r\n9) Explore the Kyoto Station. The building's futuristic design and atmosphere was conceived by the Japanese architect Hara Hiroshi. Hara's design attempts to convey historical Kyoto through a modern aesthetic. \r\n\r\n10 ) Take an evening walk down Pontocho to experience a Japanese alleyway atmosphere. Pontocho (先斗町, Pontochō) is one of Kyoto's most atmospheric dining areas. It is a narrow alley running from Shijo-dori to Sanjo-dori, one block west of Kamogawa River. "},
  {name: "Italy", image: "venice.jpg", title: "Planning Your First Trip To Italy", post: "Arguably Europe’s most enticing country, Italy charms visitors with irresistible food, awesome architecture, diverse scenery and unparalleled art. In fact, it's so packed with possibilities it can almost overwhelm.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve not visited before you could well wonder what to see? Where to go? How to travel? Here’s everything you need to know to get the absolute utmost out of your first-time Italy trip.\r\n\r\nShort on time? Start with the big three: Rome, Florence and Venice. A week is (just) enough to enjoy the country’s headline acts.\r\n\r\nThe glories of Rome\r\nA day: Rome wasn’t built in one, and you certainly can’t see it in one. Instead allow at least two, preferably three. That’s time to take in the spectacular Colosseum, the 2000-year-old Pantheon, the palace ruins of the Palatino, sacred St Peter's and the art-filled Vatican Museums. Trot up the Spanish Steps, toss a coin in the Trevi Fountain, shop in narrow lanes and indulge in prime people watching.\r\n\r\nFlorence and Tuscany: art and wine\r\nTwo days in Florence sees you cherry-picking the incomparable art in the Uffizi gallery, delighting in the frescoes in the Duomo and pondering the anatomy of Michelangelo's David. It also allows for shopping on the ultra-chic Via de' Tornabuoni and an aperitivo (pre-dinner drink) or two in locals' favourite Piazza della Signoria.\r\nCheck into one of the idyllic rural farmhouses in Chianti and spend time exploring a land where vine trellises snake along rolling hills with Romanesque churches sheltering in their folds. Wineries lie everywhere. At extraordinary Antinori, for example, the high quality of the wine is matched by high-tech architectural innovation. A day trip to gorgeously Gothic Siena sees you marvelling at the Italian ability to turn buildings into art.\r\n\r\nBewitching Venice\r\nTo enjoy unique, utterly exquisite Venice, allow a few days. Glide down the Grand Canal, by gondola or vaporetto (water bus), tour the grand Palazzo Ducale, gape at the treasure-filled Basilica di San Marco and run out of camera space snapping the extraordinary array of Venetian architecture. There'll also be time to join the locals shopping at Rialto Market, tuck into cicheti (Venetian tapas) and get a little lost amid the 400 bridges and 150 canals.\r\n\r\n[Disclaimer: Copied from Lonely Planet for app demo purposes, Link: https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/travel-tips-and-articles/planning-your-first-trip-to-italy]"},
